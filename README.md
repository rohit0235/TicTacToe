# Tic-Tac-Toe Game

## Description

This is a simple console-based implementation of the classic Tic-Tac-Toe game. It is a two-player game where players take turns to place their mark (X or O) on a 3x3 grid. The player who succeeds in placing three of their marks in a horizontal, vertical, or diagonal row wins the game. If all nine squares are filled and no player has won, the game ends in a draw.

## Features

- Two-player mode (Player X and Player O)
- Simple and intuitive user interface
- Input validation to prevent overwriting of cells
- Detection of win or draw conditions
- Restart option after the game ends

## Gameplay Rules

1. The game is played on a 3x3 grid.
2. Players take turns marking a square with their symbol: Player 1 is 'X', Player 2 is 'O'.
3. A player wins by placing three of their marks in:
   - A horizontal row
   - A vertical column
   - A diagonal line
4. The game ends in a draw if all squares are filled and neither player has achieved a winning line.

## How to Play

1. Run the game.
2. Players will be prompted to enter the number (1-9) corresponding to the position on the grid they want to mark.
3. The game will display the updated grid after each turn.
4. Once a player wins or the game ends in a draw, an option to restart the game will be provided.
